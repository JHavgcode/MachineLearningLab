Welcome to the Machine Learning Lab repository! This repository is based heavily on the fantastic work being done at the jupyter/docker-stacks repository, if you haven't checked it out please do and support the work being done there. In this reposity we include both cuda-enabled versions of a select number of images from the docker-stacks repository as well as some custom images not found there. If you would like to add images to this repository please open a pull request!
